INFO:
Trashie is a utility that lets you monitor your OS X trash from the menu bar. 
It is written in PyObjC. 
Icons are snagged from the Tango Project.

INSTALL:
To get the party started, run `python setup.py py2app`. 
Alternatively, you can run `bash setup.sh`.

TODO:
1. Flicker the menu after the trash is emptied
2. Growl support would be nice and zesty
